# Roguelike

Project created for the yearly RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial event.

This implementation is created by following along with the [Rust Roguelike Tutorial](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) using C, libtcod, and flecs.

## Dependencies

* SDL2 - 2.0.22
* libtcod - 1.20.1
* flecs - 2.4.8
* vcpkg

## Assets

Tilesets are not included in the repo, but any extended ascii tileset should work. This should include 16 columms and 16 rows for a total of 256 characters. Simply add the tileset into the same folder as the .exe with the name "tileset.png".
